Utility to pack files into zips limited by size but for complete files, not as
shared archive.

Default limit: 950 MB.

Method: ZIP_STORED (I use it on already comressed files, zip here is just Win
version of tar)

## todo (just ideas)

- display info when running
- cl option to size limit
- where output? atm it is in parent dir
